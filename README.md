# P5.js experiments

The following repository stores and will continue to store any js/P5 design and experiments involved with web based technologies

None of these are meant to be used in a broad setting and are purely for fun.\
Some Hosting might be implemented and images for the following will be added later.

## Ascii-art-video

A Basic simulator for direct conversion of webcam video to ascii art in real time using the P5-ascii library. Known issues at present include a very rigid glyph set.

IMAGES TO BE ADDED

## char-keyboard

A reactive keyboard rendered purely in ascii art. 

IMAGES TO BE ADDED

## pixel-manipulations

Initial experiments modifying and using individual pixel values as the base.\
For now only a "mask" operation is being done. An underlying image is slowly traced on to a black canvas by random chance.
